# Go Guess
Go Guess is a very simple introductory Golang project involving a quiz game. The questions and their corresponding answers are stored in a CSV, 
which is then parsed for the guessing game. Credit to Jon Calhoun of Gophercises.
# How it works
The end goal of the player is to get as many questions as they can right. The player will be asked to input the name of a CSV file with questions; the questions 
are sorted into "question" and "answer" separated by a comma. From there, the player will have to input the answers of questions being asked into the terminal; 
after all the questions are exhausted, the player will then see the total # of questions correct, and the total # of questions overall.
